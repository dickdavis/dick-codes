<p class="text-lg mb-4">Buying gifts for people is hard. I created this wishlist to make it easier for folks to buy gifts for me. I am not very keen on receiving gifts, but I do appreciate the gesture.</p>
<p class="text-lg mb-4">You could also go the easy route and just get a gift card for me, but I'll probably forget about it and never use it.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Books</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">My book collection is important to me. I am always interested in adding great books to my anti-library. The best gift anyone could get me is a great book to read.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Technology</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Technology has always interested me. Although I am mostly a software guy, I also have some interest in hardware and one of my goals for the next year is to build a homelab.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://vilros.com/products/raspberry-pi-5?variant=41433724387422" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-500 underline hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold">Raspberry Pi 5 Board</a>: I need four of these devices. My intention is to build a homelab to run a Kubernetes cluster. Note: get the 16GB memory variant that comes with the power supply and memory card.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://vilros.com/products/raspberry-pi-5-active-cooler?variant=40083112198238" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-500 underline hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold">Raspberry Pi 5 Active Cooler</a>: This will help cool each of the boards; need four of these as well.

Only need one of these.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Fitness</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">I have recently gotten back into weightlifting and need to upgrade my equipment to continue lifting heavier weights than what I am currently lifting.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://titan.fitness/products/t2-series-power-rack?variant=47796659683605" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-500 underline hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold">Titan T-2 Series Power Rack</a>: My current stand is not rated to support the weight I am working towards. Going with a actual squat rack will be much safer. Note: I need the 83" variant.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://titan.fitness/products/t2-series-10in-extension-kit?variant=47796663157013" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-500 underline hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold">Titan T-2 Series Power Rack</a>: This extension kit will add some depth to the squat rack and add some additional plate storage. Note: I need the 83" variant.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://titan.fitness/products/t-2-series-j-hooks" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-500 underline hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold">Titan T-2 Series J-Hooks</a>: The rack comes with some J-hooks, but I'd like an extra set so I don't have to constantly adjust the J-hooks for different lifts.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://titan.fitness/products/t-2-series-spotter-arms" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-500 underline hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold">Titan T-2 Series Spotter Arms</a>: This is a safety feature that is probably worth getting, though not strictly necessary.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://titan.fitness/products/performance-series-adjustable-bench" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-500 underline hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold">Titan Performance Series Adjustable Bench</a>: This bench is a significant improvement over my current bench.

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://ouraring.com/store/rings/oura-ring-4/black" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-500 underline hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold">Oura Ring 4</a>: I can't stand the idea of wearing an Apple Watch or any other smartwatch for that matter; I'm a G-Shock kind of guy. This little ring thingy looks nifty. Note: black is the safest color choice.
