<p class="text-lg mb-4">Buying gifts for people is hard. I created this wishlist to make it easier for folks to buy gifts for me. I am not very keen on receiving gifts, but I do appreciate the gesture.</p>
<p class="text-lg mb-4">You could also go the easy route and just get a gift card for me, but I'll probably forget about it and never use it.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Books</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">My book collection is important to me. I am always interested in adding great books to my anti-library. The best gift anyone could get me is a great book to read.</p>

As such, there aren't many political books that I'm interested in.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Technology</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Technology has always interested me. Although I am mostly a software guy, I also have some interest in hardware and one of my goals for the next year is to build a homelab.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://vilros.com/products/raspberry-pi-5?variant=41433724387422" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-500 underline hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold">Raspberry Pi 5 Board</a>: I need four of these devices. My intention is to build a homelab to run a Kubernetes cluster. Note: get the 16GB memory variant that comes with the power supply and memory card.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://vilros.com/products/raspberry-pi-5-active-cooler?variant=40083112198238" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-500 underline hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold">Raspberry Pi 5 Active Cooler</a>: This will help cool each of the boards; need four of these as well.

Only need one of these.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Fitness</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">I have recently gotten back into weightlifting and need to upgrade my equipment to continue lifting heavier weights than what I am currently lifting. I'm only interested in acquiring Rogue Fitness equipment because they make their products in America.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-r-3-power-rack" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-500 underline hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold">Rogue R-3 Power Rack</a>: My current stand is not rated to support the weight I am working towards. Going with a actual squat rack will be much safer. Note: I need the 90" variant.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roguefitness.com/set-of-safety-spotter-arms" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-500 underline hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold">Safety Spotter Arms</a>: This is a safety feature that is probably worth getting, though not strictly necessary.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roguefitness.com/sp2358-plate-storage-long-for-infinity" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-500 underline hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold">Plate Storage</a>: I'd like 2-3 pairs of plate storage pegs to keep my plates nice and tidy.

      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-flat-utility-bench-2-0" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-500 underline hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold">Utility Bench</a>: I love how simple this bench is. It's exactly what I need. There is nothing more annoying than the leg curl dohickey permanently attached to my current bench.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://ouraring.com/store/rings/oura-ring-4/black" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-500 underline hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold">Oura Ring 4</a>: I can't stand the idea of wearing an Apple Watch or any other smartwatch for that matter; I'm a G-Shock kind of guy. This little ring thingy looks nifty. Note: black is the safest color choice.
