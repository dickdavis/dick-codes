  <p class="page-content__text">Buying gifts for people is hard. I created this wishlist to make it easier for folks to buy gifts for me. I am not very keen on receiving gifts, but I do appreciate the gesture.</p>
  <p class="page-content__text">You could also go the easy route and just get a gift card for me, but I'll probably forget about it and never use it.</p>
